# Load Instruction and Assembly Labels

The Little Man Computer (LMC) uses a simple assembly language. Peter Higginson's website has (documentation that explains the LMC and it's assembly language)[https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/help.html].

The LMC has just 9 different operations it can perform. Rather than having to memorize which opcode corresponds to which instruction and manually typing in the machine instructions, LMC offers an *assembly language* to assist programmers.
The LMC assembly language uses 3 letter mnemonics. Refer to the documentation above to see all the assembly instructions.
