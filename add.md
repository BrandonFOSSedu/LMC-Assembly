# ADD - The Add Instruction
The main function of a computer is to *compute*. Computation is, at it's root, just basic mathematics. A CPU does not do much more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.  

The Little Man Computer comes with only two mathematical instructions, `ADD` and `SUB`.  

## ADD
`ADD address` - Add the value in the accumulator with the value stored at *address*  

Put into an equation we have this equivalance:  
`ADD address` = `Accumulator = Accumulator + value at address`
